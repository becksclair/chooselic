# Choose License

Choose a license for your project in the terminal via [GitHub Licenses API](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/rest/licenses/licenses)

## Usage

Run the `chooselic` command to create a license file in your project. You can also set `year` and `author` properties for auto replacing these fields in the license.
